# BlogBuilderJS

## Description

This project is a personal blog application designed to allow users to post their thoughts and experiences. I built this project to deepen my understanding of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to demonstrate my ability to work with client-side storage and event handling.

- **Motivation**: The motivation behind this project was to create a functional web application that could serve as a personal blogging platform.
- **Problem Solved**: This application provides a simple and user-friendly interface for users to publish their blog posts without the need for backend infrastructure, using `localStorage` to store data persistently on the client's machine.
- **What I Learned**: Through this project, I learned about DOM manipulation, event handling in JavaScript, and the use of `localStorage` to store and retrieve data. I also improved my skills in responsive web design using Bootstrap.
